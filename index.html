        <div class="project">
            <h3>Amazone Clone</h3>
            <p>The HTML and CSS-based Amazon clone replicates the visual layout of Amazon's homepage,
                focusing on key elements such as the header, navigation, product listings, and footer.
                It includes a header section with the Amazon logo, search bar, and navigation links 
                for signing in, viewing orders, and accessing the shopping cart. The main content area 
                features product listings displayed in a grid layout, each showcasing product images, titles, 
                descriptions, and pricing. CSS is used to style elements such as background colors, typography, margins,
                and padding to closely resemble Amazon's design aesthetic. The footer section provides copyright information 
                and maintains consistency with the header's color scheme. This static representation aims to demonstrate the 
                layout and visual presentation of an e-commerce site like Amazon using foundational HTML and CSS techniques.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Stopwatch</h3>
            <p>The stopwatch is a simple web-based application created with HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the stopwatch,
                including buttons to control the stopwatch and a display area to show 
                the elapsed time. CSS is used to style the interface, ensuring a clean
                and user-friendly design. JavaScript handles the functionality, including 
                starting, stopping, and resetting the timer, as well as updating the display in real-time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Tic tac toe</h3>
            <p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that involves marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with either
                an "X" or an "O". Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that can be implemented on a webpage 
                using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The game board consists
                of a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking the cells. The game detects when a player wins by 
                completing a row, column, or diagonal with their marks, or ends in a draw when all cells are filled without a winner. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>weather web-App</h3>
            <p>A weather web application allows users to enter a location (city or coordinates) and retrieves current weather
                conditions and forecasts. The application displays weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, 
                and conditions (like sunny, cloudy, rainy) using graphical elements like icons. Users can interact with the app 
                by entering different locations or toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The interface is designed to be responsive
                and visually appealing, often featuring backgrounds that reflect current weather conditions (e.g., sunny for clear weather,
                rainy for showers). JavaScript handles the dynamic fetching of weather data from a weather API, updating the UI with
                the retrieved information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Responsive landing page</h3>
            <p>A responsive landing page serves as the entry point for visitors to learn about a product or service and take
                desired actions, such as signing up, making a purchase, or contacting the business. It features a compelling 
                headline, concise messaging, captivating visuals (like images or videos), and clear calls-to-action (CTAs). 
                The layout adjusts fluidly based on the device screen size, ensuring readability and usability without horizontal
                scrolling or content distortion. CSS media queries are used to implement responsive design principles, while
                JavaScript enhances functionality like form validation or interactive elements. The landing page aims to convert
                visitors into leads or customers by delivering a seamless browsing experience tailored to their device.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Music Recommendation System</h3>
            <p>
                A music recommendation system is a web-based application that suggests songs to users based on their preferences.
                The music recommendation system uses Python for data preprocessing and machine learning. It collects user data such as listening history and preferences, cleans and prepares it with pandas, and trains machine learning models (like collaborative filtering or content-based methods).
                These models analyze user behavior to suggest songs or playlists based on similarity or attributes (like genre). The system can be deployed as a web app with streamlit, integrating with music streaming APIs for real-time recommendations and user interaction to refine suggestions continuously.
